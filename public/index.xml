      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bringing a wealth of experience in university education, I have supported students across various nursing programs, offering guidance in both practical placements and academic theory. Personalised tutoring plays a crucial role in improving academic writing skills, and aiding students in reaching their desired grades.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My teaching philosophy focuses on creating a supportive and inclusive learning atmosphere that encourages individuals to pursue nursing careers. In 2023, I was honored to receive a nomination from my students and reach the final stages of consideration for the esteemed Student Nursing Times University Educator of the Year award.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Upon completing your NMC registration successfully, the journey to landing your new job begins. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to focus on being shortlisted and excelling in your interview. The nursing job market in the UK is increasingly competitive, and securing a position is not always guaranteed. With experience interviewing registered nurses as an intensive care sister, I understand what qualities make a candidate successful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Standing out amongst the competition requires preparation, confidence, and showcasing your unique skills and experiences. Remember, each interview is an opportunity to demonstrate your value to potential employers and secure your desired nursing position in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 class=&#34;title is-3&#34;&gt;NMC OSCE Exam&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;International nurses must complete the NMC OSCE exam as part of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Test of Competence. The OSCE exam is designed to assess whether candidates meet UK standards of nursing practice. The process of preparing for the exam as an individual can be overwhelming and as a result, international nurses normally seek some form of training from the many independent training centres and courses in the UK providing OSCE training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
