      <description>&lt;h3 class=&#34;title is-3&#34;&gt;NMC OSCE Exam&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;International nurses must complete the NMC OSCE exam as part of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Test of Competence. The OSCE exam is designed to assess whether candidates meet UK standards of nursing practice. The process of preparing for the exam as an individual can be overwhelming and as a result, international nurses normally seek some form of training from the many independent training centres and courses in the UK providing OSCE training.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
