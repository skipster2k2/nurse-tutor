      <h3 class="title is-3">NMC OSCE Exam</h3>
<p>International nurses must complete the NMC OSCE exam as part of the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) Test of Competence. The OSCE exam is designed to assess whether candidates meet UK standards of nursing practice. The process of preparing for the exam as an individual can be overwhelming and as a result, international nurses normally seek some form of training from the many independent training centres and courses in the UK providing OSCE training.</p>
<p>Recently I have had several international nurses contact me looking for tutoring and support with their 2nd and 3rd attempts after attending training centres and being disappointed with the learning experience of being sat in a classroom all day and having content directly delivered to them.</p>
<p>As an international nurse, finding the right form of guidance and support is essential. NMC OSCE training can be hugely expensive with some courses costing over Â£1000 for 5 days.</p>
<h3 class="title is-3">Understanding Training vs. Tutoring</h3>
<h4 class="title is-4">What is OSCE Training?</h4>
<p>Training usually takes place in a structured environment, such as a classroom or a training centre, and is often designed for a larger group. The focus is normally on providing general information and covering the standard NMC exam content.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what you can typically expect from training:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standardised Curriculum:</strong> Training programs follow a fixed syllabus, focusing on covering key topics for the NMC exam.</li>
<li><strong>Group Learning:</strong> Training centres cater to groups of students, so lessons are often delivered in a one-size-fits-all manner. However, learning with a group of people can make you feel supported and not alone in your preparation.</li>
<li><strong>Fixed Schedule:</strong> Training sessions are normally conducted at specific times, set training weeks or dates.  This can enable you to pre-plan a long way in advance.</li>
<li><strong>Less Personalisation:</strong> With a large group to manage, trainers may not have the time to focus on individual learning needs, making it harder to get targeted support for areas where you may struggle. It also means students have to move at the same pace through subjects with no opportunity to spend more time on weaker areas.</li>
<li><strong>Limited Practice Time and Feedback:</strong> Due to the time constraints and number of students it can be very difficult to fit in enough practice time, and be observed in your practice and get feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="title is-4">What is Tutoring?</h4>
<p>Tutoring is an established method of individualizing learning and is used throughout education but has been underutilized in the NMC OSCE training. However, tutoring brings many benefits to International Nurses. As a tutor, I create an individualised learning approach working closely with my students to tailor our lessons to suit their needs and pace. I recognise and acknowledge their existing skills and nursing education and will build my sessions on this.</p>
<p>Here are the key aspects of my  tutoring approach</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Personalised Learning:</strong> I will design a custom learning plan based on the International nurse&rsquo;s specific knowledge, skills, strengths, and weaknesses. A one-size-fits-all training course might not address specific gaps in knowledge or skills related to these differences or alternatively waste time on areas you are competent with already.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible Sessions:</strong> Unlike rigid training schedules, I offer sessions that can be arranged at times that suit the international nurse&rsquo;s availability. A lot of my international nurses often juggle multiple responsibilities, including full-time work, family obligations, and study. Attending a training centre with a fixed schedule can be difficult.  This flexibility is particularly valuable when preparing for the NMC OSCE. You can arrange one-on-one sessions at a time that works best for you, ensuring you get the full benefit of each with no need to book a week of work to attend a training centre or arrange child care.</li>
<li><strong>Targeted Support:</strong> I can help international nurses focus on the specific areas where they are struggling. Allowing more time on areas that require extra support and not wasting time on areas the nurse is competent and secure with.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Tutoring provides excellent accountability and focus for your studies. I have started to increase specific tasks for my tutees on a weekly basis, as they know they are meeting with me they have greater motivation to complete them, which increases their knowledge and practice time directly impacting exam results and pass rates.</li>
<li><strong>Immediate Feedback:</strong> In education, feedback is viewed as one of the most important influences on learning and development. Tutoring allows me to give immediate, personalised feedback, allowing international nurses to correct mistakes, reflect and deepen their understanding on the spot.</li>
<li><strong>Affordability and Value:</strong> While tutoring may be though of as being more expensive, it often provides more value for your money in the long run. Tutors will also not have the large overhead costs that training centres have so you may be surprised to find out that tutoring often costs much less than you would think. With targeted learning, you might need fewer sessions to reach your goal than if you were attending a training centre. I will also give you the specific help you need without wasting time on content youâre already familiar with, making it a cost-effective choice for international nurses.</li>
<li><strong>Building Confidence:</strong> Tutoring can help build confidence prior to the exam. While training centres may offer mock exams or practical sessions, theyâre often limited by time and group dynamics. I can provide individualized mock exams and one-on-one role-play practice scenarios, giving international nurses the chance to practice as much as they need to. This approach helps you feel more comfortable with exam formats, especially for the OSCE, where nerves can affect performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>For international nurses preparing for the NMC exam, choosing tutoring over training can make the entire process more manageable and effective. The personalized approach, flexible booking, and targeted support can significantly increase your chances of passing the exam on your first attempt. Training centres might offer generalized knowledge, but tutoring ensures that your unique needs are met, allowing you to focus on areas where you need the most help and boosting your confidence for exam day.</p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re preparing to become a registered nurse in the UK, consider investing in a tutor who can guide you through the complexities of the NMC exam with personalised, expert support. It could be the difference between feeling overwhelmed and walking into the exam fully prepared and confident.</p>
