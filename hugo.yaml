    - name: Hannah O
      quote: The best tutor I’ve ever had—and so affordable too! I was preparing for a resit and desperately needed guidance to ensure I passed the next time. Hannah was truly an answered prayer. She’s incredibly knowledgeable and immediately put me at ease. Together, we went through every station thoroughly, and she made sure I was fully prepared and confident. Her belief in her students is inspiring, and it gave me the boost I needed.

    - name: Joe Nieves
      quote: I had the opportunity to reach out to Hannah for tutoring and had a wonderful learning experience.  Hannah and I coordinated and focused on areas that I needed more practice with, rather than some companies that spend time on areas you don’t need much focus on.  Great individualized tutoring and highly recommend Hannah for any tutoring one may need.

      quote: All international nurses looking for support in preparing for the OSCE should take note. I'm excited to introduce Nurse Tutor Hannah, who is truly exceptional at what she does. She makes navigating the OSCE a breeze. Her resource materials and training sessions, whether online or in person, are incredibly impactful. My experience with her was outstanding, and her support proved invaluable.
