With a wealth of experience as an educator and former OSCE program lead, I possess the knowledge and expertise required to support you in successfully passing your NMC OSCE exam.

My sessions are customized to suit your schedule, accommodating your work and family commitments.

In contrast to large training facilities I provide:

- A unique and individualized approach to help you prepare for your OSCE
- Focus not just on passing the exam but also on developing your knowledge and confidence for UK nursing
- Training at your convenience without needing to take time off work. 
- No hidden costs

I take pride in teaching you the latest evidence-based theory to assist you in passing the OSCE exam and advancing your career as a UK registered nurse. I am fully invested in your success and will provide ongoing support and mentorship.

All tutoring clients receive ongoing support until they have successfully passed the NMC exam and  I am proud of my 100% pass rate and excellent reviews.
