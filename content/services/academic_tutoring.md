Bringing a wealth of experience in university education, I have supported students across various nursing programs, offering guidance in both practical placements and academic theory. Personalised tutoring plays a crucial role in improving academic writing skills, and aiding students in reaching their desired grades.

My teaching philosophy focuses on creating a supportive and inclusive learning atmosphere that encourages individuals to pursue nursing careers. In 2023, I was honored to receive a nomination from my students and reach the final stages of consideration for the esteemed Student Nursing Times University Educator of the Year award.
