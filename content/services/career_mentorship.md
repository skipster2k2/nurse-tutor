Upon completing your NMC registration successfully, the journey to landing your new job begins. It's essential to focus on being shortlisted and excelling in your interview. The nursing job market in the UK is increasingly competitive, and securing a position is not always guaranteed. With experience interviewing registered nurses as an intensive care sister, I understand what qualities make a candidate successful.

Standing out amongst the competition requires preparation, confidence, and showcasing your unique skills and experiences. Remember, each interview is an opportunity to demonstrate your value to potential employers and secure your desired nursing position in the UK.
